     /*
    1. Integer
    The keyword int can represent integer data types. The range of integers is -2147483648 to 2147483647, and they take up 4 bytes of memory.

    For example,
     */
    int data = 1526;
    
    /*
    2. Character
    The keyword char represent characters. It is 1 byte in size. Single quotes ' ' are used to enclose characters in C++.

    For example,
    */
    char ch = 's';

    /*
    3. Boolean
    The boolean data type's keyword is bool. True or false are the two possible values for the boolean data type. Boolean values are generally used in conditional statements and loops.

    For example,
    */
    bool is_true = true; // or false

    /*
    4. Floating Point
    float is the keyword used to hold floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials). The float variable has a size of 4 bytes.

    For example,
    */
    float val = 15.26;

    /*

    5. Double Floating Point
    double is the keyword used to hold floating-point numbers (decimals and exponentials) with double precision. The double variable has a size of 8 bytes.

    For example,
    */

    double val = 2019.1526;

    /*
    6. Void or Valueless
    The term void refers to something that has no worth. The void data type represents a valueless entity. Variables of the void type cannot be declared. It is only used for functions, not returning any data.
    */

    /*
    7. Wide Character
    The wide-character wchar_t data type is similar to the char data type, but its size is 2 or 4 bytes rather than 1 byte. It's used to represent characters that take up more memory than a single char to represent.

    For example,
    */
    wchar_t w = L'C';
